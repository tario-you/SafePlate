[React native comments](https://github.com/tokict/react-native-comments) is a presentational component for rendering Facebook like comments with likes, reporting, replying, pagination, etc. The pagination and actions are proxied
which means you need to have your own pagination and data storage solution and implement action logic (liking, reporting etc).

## Getting started
Tested with RN 0.63.4

`$ npm install react-native-comments --save`

If you don't have the dependency `react-native-vector-icons`, please make sure you install it properly for your app:


## Implementation notes

You should add a scroll to end of comments on a successful save action

Do not update comments if the user is not expecting update. Updating comments could close some modals the user was potentially viewing

Edit, Delete and Report are available on long press on comment container.
